I have been in the field of Software Engineering for two years as a full-stack developer. I have primarily used Golang for backend development and the
Angular framework for frontend development, additionally I have used Docker as a container engine for these applications, and Kubernetes as container
orchestration for deployment. I'm also familiar with technologies including Java, C++, C#, Python, Kafka, MongoDB, SQL, Shell, etc., and have grown
intensely familiar with agile development practices and CICD.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and expand my skillset. Currently, I have been working on a side project of turning an old desktop
into a functioning webserver so that I can host my own services. It has been a fun challenge, and has helped me learn more about containerization,
deployment, networking, and microservices, and has been a great opportunity to improve my development skills.
